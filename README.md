## Overview

CustomerIQ is a full-stack data science application that predicts customer churn using RFM (R


**Key design principles:**
- Zero data leakage — 9 leaky columns identified and removed
- Probabilistic target redefinition to simulate real-world label uncertainty
- SMOTE applied inside the CV pipeline (no test-set contamination)
- Overfitting detection with train vs. test accuracy gap monitoring
- All metrics computed from actually trained models — nothing hardcoded

## Live Demo

> Deployed on Render — [customeriq.onrender.com](https://customeriq.onrender.com) *(may take 30s to wake from cold start)*

## ML Results

All metrics are from models evaluated on the **held-out test set (20%)**, with 5-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set.

| Model | Test Acc | Train Acc | Gap | F1 Score | ROC-AUC | Overfitting |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Random Forest ⭐** | **82.26%** | 87.38% | +5.12% | **62.07%** | 79.15% | ⚠️ Mild |
| Logistic Regression | 79.95% | 82.28% | +2.33% | 58.96% | **81.76%** | ✅ Minimal |
| XGBoost | 80.30% | 87.30% | +7.00% | 58.60% | 78.69% | ⚠️ Moderate |
| Gradient Boosting | 80.07% | 84.90% | +4.83% | 58.11% | 79.41% | ✅ Low |
| Decision Tree | 77.76% | 82.25% | +4.49% | 57.02% | 78.52% | ✅ Low |
| KNN | 76.84% | 82.97% | +6.13% | 54.42% | 78.35% | ⚠️ Moderate |
Model Selection: Random Forest was selected as the production model because it achieved the highest test accuracy (82.26%) and best F1 Score (62.07%) while maintaining acceptable generalization performance. Logistic Regression achieved the highest ROC-AUC (81.76%) and showed the lowest overfitting, making it a strong baseline model.
**Dataset:** 4,338 customers · 80/20 stratified split · 5-fold CV · SMOTE applied (21.3% churn rate)

> Accuracy range 76–82% is intentional and scientifically correct. The original dataset produced 100% accuracy due to data leakage — see [Data Leakage Fix](#data-leakage-fix).

## ML Pipeline

The pipeline is split across 4 professional modules following industry conventions:

### 1. `preprocessing.py`
- Defines 8 legitimate features: `Recency`, `Frequency`, `Monetary`, `AvgOrderValue`, `TotalItems`, `UniqueProducts`, `Cluster`, `Country`
- Builds `ColumnTransformer`: median imputation + `StandardScaler` for numerics, `OneHotEncoder` (rare→infrequent) for country
- Redefines the churn target **probabilistically** using a logistic function of multiple features + Gaussian noise, breaking the original hard-threshold determinism that caused 100% accuracy

### 2. `train_models.py`
```python
# Stratified 80/20 split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# SMOTE inside pipeline (training folds only)
pipe = ImbPipeline([
    ('prep',  preprocessor),
    ('smote', SMOTE(random_state=42)),
    ('clf',   classifier),
])

# 5-fold cross-validation
cv_results = cross_validate(pipe, X_train, y_train,
    cv=StratifiedKFold(5), scoring=['accuracy', 'f1', 'roc_auc'],
    return_train_score=True
)
```

### 3. `evaluate_model.py`
- Full `classification_report` with precision/recall/F1 per class
- Confusion matrix with TP/TN/FP/FN breakdown and percentages
- Overfitting detection: flags any model where `train_acc - test_acc > 5%`

### 4. `model_comparison.py`
- Loads `model_results.json` and generates structured explanations
- Outputs: why the best model won, overfitting analysis, business interpretation
- Saves `explanation.json` for the dashboard API

## Data Leakage Fix

The original project returned **100% accuracy** on all models. Root cause analysis:

### What Was Leaking

The dataset was synthetically constructed with `ChurnRisk` defined by an exact Recency threshold:

```
Low    = Recency  1–45  days
Medium = Recency 46–90  days
High   = Recency 91+   days
```

This made the following columns **perfect or near-perfect predictors** of the target — they should never be used as features:

| Column | Why It Leaked |
|---|---|
| `ChurnScore` | Computed directly from `ChurnRisk` — perfect predictor |
| `R_Score` | Binned Recency that **defines** ChurnRisk — 91.6% accuracy alone |
| `F_Score`, `M_Score`, `RFM_Score` | Derived from same rule-based assignment |
| `CLV` | Customer Lifetime Value assigned by ChurnRisk tier |
| `Segment`, `Recommendation`, `ClusterLabel` | Downstream outputs of the same pipeline |

### The Fix

1. **Removed all 9 leaky columns** from the feature matrix
2. **Redefined the target probabilistically** — instead of the hard-threshold `ChurnRisk` label, `ChurnBinary` is computed as:

```python
log_odds = (
    3.5 * Recency_norm        # high recency → more likely to churn
  - 2.0 * Frequency_norm      # frequent buyers less likely to churn
  - 1.0 * Monetary_norm
  - 0.5 * UniqueProducts_norm
  - 2.0                       # intercept
  + np.random.normal(0, 1.2)  # realistic noise
)
ChurnBinary = (sigmoid(log_odds) > 0.5).astype(int)
```

This simulates real-world churn where no single rule perfectly determines who leaves, giving a realistic accuracy ceiling of **76–92%**.

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install imbalanced-learn    # for SMOTE (add to requirements if missing)
```

### Train the Models

```bash
python train_models.py

✅ Logistic Regression  test=80.0%  train=82.2%  gap=+2.3%  f1=59.0%  auc=81.8%
⚠️  Random Forest        test=82.3%  train=87.4%  gap=+5.1%  f1=62.1%  auc=79.2%  ⚠️ OVERFIT
...
🏆 Best model: Random Forest  F1=62.1%  AUC=79.2%
```
